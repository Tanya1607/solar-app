#  Solar Rooftop AI

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes rooftop images to assess their solar panel installation potential using AI. Users can upload an image and receive an automated analysis with insights.
I have also added Ai so that if we pass any other image it will automatically tell us that the image is inappropriate.
